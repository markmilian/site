Thanks for stopping by.

I wanted a lightweight place to share occasional notes and links beyond social media bios. Posts here will stay short and useful: what I’m reading, what I’m editing, and what I’m learning about storytelling in a noisy information cycle.

If you’re interested in media, technology, or narrative craft, check back now and then.
