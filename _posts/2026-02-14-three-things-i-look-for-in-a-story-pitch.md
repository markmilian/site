A strong pitch doesn’t have to be long, but it should answer three questions quickly:

1. **What is actually new?** If it could have run six months ago with no changes, it’s probably background, not a story.
2. **Why does it matter now?** Timeliness can come from policy, markets, people, or cultural momentum.
3. **Who are the characters?** Great reporting lands when readers can follow real people through real stakes.

If those three pieces are in place, everything else is much easier.
